title: About Me
description: Developer based in Calgary, AB, I specialize in crafting thoughtful, user-centered digital products for both web and mobile. With years of hands-on experience, I love combining clean design, solid engineering, and real-world usability to deliver smooth, high-quality experiences. Fully bilingual in French and English, I collaborate easily across teams, clients, and projects. Whether working independently or alongside a team, I bring a sharp eye for detail, a problem-solving mindset, and a dedication to shipping polished, reliable work. From Shopify stores to custom applications, performance and quality are always at the core of what I build. Outside of client work, I’m constantly experimenting, learning, and creating. Personal projects, open-source contributions, and ongoing exploration help me stay fresh, curious, and always pushing my craft further.
